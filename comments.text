Basically i could understand with watching the videos in class, but i wont lie to you. i did have an issue with the 
- Money class
- CreditCard class
i had my copilot help with the part i had an issue with but still dont know if it is correct.
A feedback on what i need to work on would be great. otherwise the first 2 problems were okay with the class exercises and i had to watch the videos again to be certain and used the examples we did in class for them.
